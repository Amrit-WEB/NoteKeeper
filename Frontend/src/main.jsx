/*
Redux persist:-
Redux Persist is a library that enables seamless persisting and
rehydrating of your Redux store state. It allows you to save your 
applicationâ€™s state to a persistent storage medium, such as local 
storage or AsyncStorage (for React Native), and then restore it when 
the application is restarted or refreshed.
